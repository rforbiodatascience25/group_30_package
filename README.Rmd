## Introduction

The group 30 package provides a set of functions that allow users to generate random DNA sequences, convert DNA to RNA, identify codons, translate codons into amino acids, and visualize amino acid composition as a histogram.

### 1. Creating a DNA Sequence

The `create_dna_sequence()` function randomly generates a DNA sequence of the desired length.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dna_seq <- create_dna_sequence(30)
dna_seq
```

### 2. Transcribing DNA to RNA

`dna_to_rna()` converts a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence by replacing all thymine (T) bases with uracil (U).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rna_seq <- dna_to_rna(dna_seq)
rna_seq
```

### 3. Finding Codons

The `find_codons()` function breaks a DNA or RNA sequence into triplets (codons). These codons represent the smallest meaningful units in translation.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
codons <- find_codons(rna_seq)
head(codons)
```

### 4. Translating Codons to Amino Acids

The `AASeq()` function converts codons into their corresponding amino acids, using a standard codon table (`standard_codon`).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
AA_sequence <- AASeq()
AA_sequence
```

### 5. Visualizing Amino Acid Composition

The `amino_histogram()` function generates a histogram of amino acid frequencies in the translated sequence.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
amino_histogram(AA_sequence)
```

### Combining Functions: A Full Workflow

All functions can be used together to simulate the entire gene-to-protein process:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
full_dna <- create_dna_sequence(60)
full_rna <- dna_to_rna(full_dna)
full_codons <- find_codons(full_rna)
full_amino <- AASeq(full_codons)
amino_histogram(full_amino)

```

## Discussion and Use Cases

### Handling Dependencies

For function 5 (`amino_histogram`), we needed to use the packages stringr and ggplot2. We added them as dependencies by:

1.  Using `@importFrom stringr str_split boundary str_count` in the function’s documentation so that only the specific functions we need are imported.
2.  Using ggplot2 directly for the plotting commands in the function body.

This approach ensures that our package does not load entire packages unnecessarily, which reduces namespace conflicts and keeps installation lightweight.

### Limiting Dependencies

It’s generally a good idea to minimize the number of dependencies your package uses because each additional dependency increases the chance of installation failures, dependencies can bring in their own bugs or breaking changes in future versions, and fewer dependencies make your package more portable and easier to maintain.

However, some dependencies are unavoidable if your package needs specialized functionality (e.g., ggplot2 for plotting, dplyr for data manipulation). In those cases, careful selection and documenting them in DESCRIPTION is important.

### **`@importFrom` vs `package::function()`**

@importFrom`package function` in the Roxygen documentation, imports only the specified functions when building the namespace. This is more lightweight and avoids loading the entire package unnecessarily. `package::function()` calls a function directly without importing it, which works anywhere, but does not automatically make it available for other functions in your package. We used a combination of both approaches to balance efficiency, clarity, and namespace management.

### Use cases

This package models the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA -\> RNA -\> Protein, in a simple and reproducible way. It can be used in bioinformatics education to demonstrate sequence translation or simulation experiments to test codon bias or amino acid composition.

### Possible extensions

Future versions of the package could include functions for the reverse translation, protein into DNA. In addition, there could also be added mutation simulation tools to introduce point mutations.
